# Multi-Axis-Cube-Rotation
This project consist of a cube which can be rotated in the X,Y and Z axis by using buttons. The project was done using HTML and JavaScript using webgl. I created this project to help Engineering and Math students 
accurately visualise the different axis of rotation, because it seems hard to just grasp by way of imagination.

**PS TO SEE TEXTURE OF CUBE HTML PAGE MUST BE RUN USING LIVE SERVER IN VS CODE IN ORDER TO SEE CUBE TEXTURE****

No external library was used in the process of creating the project just alot of math and matrices. I did this just to see how far I can push myself.
For best experience copy and paste the code into VS code and run it on your machine.

Some screenshots of the application are shown below:
